"""Instant home control (optional): spoken home requests go straight to Home Assistant during a call.

Offered automatically when this Hermes profile already has Home Assistant set up (Hermes' own
``HASS_URL`` / ``HASS_TOKEN``) and Home Assistant answers. When it is on, a handoff that is clearly
about the user's devices ("lights off except the bedroom, den to 72, fan on") is planned by ONE
call to the user's own fast routing model (Hermes auxiliary task ``speakeasy_router``) against the
list of devices the user chose, checked, and sent to Home Assistant. That takes about a second
instead of a full Hermes run. Multi-step requests work when every step is a plain device command.

Anything else goes to Hermes unchanged: timing or conditions ("at 11", "if nobody's home"),
routines, anything the planner isn't sure about, any device not on the user's list, and every lock,
alarm, garage door or other security device (never offered here at all).

Safety: the planner can only name devices from the list; every call is checked against that list,
an allowlist of services, and each device's own limits before anything is sent. Success is only
spoken after Home Assistant accepts every call. The token is read per use from Hermes and is never
stored, logged or spoken.
