"""Getting the pairing link to the Mac the user will talk from.

Hermes may run on the Mac the user talks from (setup opens the link there) or on another
computer. For another computer, setup sends one link to a chat the user already has with their
agent. That link goes to a page on speakeasyvoice.ai which opens Speakeasy if it's installed, or
offers the download first. The server address and code sit in the URL fragment (after ``#``), which browsers
never send to the web server.

Setup also never restarts Hermes. When the voice server isn't running yet, setup records who
asked (``pending_link.json``) and the user restarts Hermes themselves. On the next start the voice
platform finds that record and sends the link, so nobody has to come back and ask for it.
