"""Settle thread tasks nobody is waiting on any more.

A task that runs in a new chat thread is watched by a wait inside the call's worker. A gateway
restart or a plugin reload ends that wait, and nothing else ever marks the task finished, so it
stayed "running" forever: the app showed it spinning and the voice kept treating it as open. This
sweep finds those tasks and settles them from the thread itself.
