"""Continue an existing Hermes conversation from voice ("in the trip planning chat, also book ...").

Candidates are the user's recent live Hermes
sessions on any messaging platform (a Discord thread, a Telegram chat, a Slack channel, ...), read
read-only from ``<HERMES_HOME>/state.db``. Matching is deterministic (no third-party classifier):
the request must carry a continuation cue and clearly share words with exactly one recent
conversation's title/name.

The turn runs through ``/api/sessions/{id}/chat/stream`` with an ``X-Hermes-Session-Key`` alias,
the only API path that fans a completed turn back out to the native chat. The alias is added once
through Hermes' own config writer (comment-preserving) when running inside the gateway.
